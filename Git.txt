About braching {

    1. we use branching to work separetly on project without affecting the main project
    2. we should create seperate branch
    3. to create seperate branch => git branch {newBranchName => testing}
    4. Now we have create a new branch inside our main brnach 
    5. to switch from main branch to newBranch => git checkout {newBranchName} 
    6. to upload code from newBranch just go to your remoteName and newBranchName and
       git push -u {remoteName-> dhiraj} {newBranchName => testing}


    - to delete the branch => git branch -D {branchName}
